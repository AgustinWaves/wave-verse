        <h1 className='about-text'>Being curious is what defines me. Although, defining yourself is also limiting yourself at the same time. The fact is, that we are beings in constant movement, constant change; we are not static objects. I always try to make my younger self proud of who I am today. Hard work, making music and enjoying the little things is what makes me happy. The art of capturing moments is something I am always fascinated by.
        The final fact is, that I'm a nonstop learner. Learning for me equates to exploring new ideas and growing as an individual.</h1>
